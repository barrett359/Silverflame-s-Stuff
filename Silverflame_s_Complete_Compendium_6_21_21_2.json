				"You create 10 semi-tangible, visible magical orbs (called “eyes”) These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Tiny construct, about three inches in diameter, that has 1 hit point, AC 18, flies at a speed of 30 feet, and has a +12  Dexterity (Stealth) modifier. It has a Wisdom (Perception) of +8 and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch, and can squeeze through gaps as narrow as 1 inch.",
				"When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. ",
				"A sample command: “Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures.” The phrase “Surround me” directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous. A “peasant” that is actually a shape changed dragon wouldn’t trigger an eye’s return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between them-selves see everything that crosses the ring. ",
				"Another sample command: “Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return.” The phrase “Spread out” directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him. ",
				"Other commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions. ",
				"In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears. If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won’t know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event. The eyes exist for up to 8 hours or until they return to you. Dispel magic can destroy the eyes."

You could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area.

Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another.

Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal {@damage 1d6} psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.

Each wall is 5 feet thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels. You can place up to four ice doors in the fortress's outer wall. Each doorway is a 10-foot wide, 3-foot thick, set of double doors that is magically locked by the arcane lock spell and has an 10-foot wide ice stairway leading up the outer slope.",
				"A central tower stands inside the enclosed area. The tower has a circular base that is a 20-foot radius, and it has five floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the tower are connected by ice staircases, its walls are 1 foot thick, and interior rooms can have ice doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, but all the furnishings and decorations are composed of ice or snow. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell crumble to powdery snow if removed from the fortress.",
				"When you cast the spell, you can choose for the fortress to not be attached to the ground. While inside the fortress, as an action you can direct it to move. The fortress drifts slowly along the ground in a straight line with a speed of 10 feet, and can travel up to 24 miles a day. The fortress continues to move in a straight line until you issue another command or it encounters a Huge or larger obstacle. You can use your action on each of your turns to change the fortress' direction or command it to stop. The fortress can only move through open terrain and cannot travel up slopes steeper than a gentle hill. Creatures in the fortress' path are harmlessly pushed along with it. A creature can use its action to make a Strength ability check against your spell save DC to stop the fortress, or push it in a direction if it is currently immobile.",
				"You can also cast this spell on the surface of a body of water. When you do so, the underneath of the fortress is supported by a 60-foot radius hemisphere of ice. You can command the floating fortress to move just as you would on land, though currents and rough seas may affect your movement, at the DM's discretion.",
				"A staff of ten {@condition invisible} servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell.",
				"The walls and tower are all made of ice that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of ice has AC 13 and 50 hit points per foot of thickness. It is immune to cold, poison, and psychic damage. Reducing a section of ice to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM's discretion. Unless a section is destroyed, it regains 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns while in below freezing temperatures. Cold damage heals the structures by a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt. In temperatures above freezing, the fortress rapidly melts as it takes 1 fire damage at the start of each of your turns.",
				"After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.",
				"Casting this spell on the same fortress once every day for a year makes the fortress permanent."

On a hit, the creature takes 2d10 lightning damage and 2d10 thunder damage and you can cause the lightning to arc from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of it. The second creature takes half the damage of the attack."
